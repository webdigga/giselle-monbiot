content: Throughout the year, I offer a range of specialised events and courses
  designed to support healing, reconnection and inner balance. These include
  breathwork courses where you’ll learn the restorative art of conscious
  breathing, women’s groups that weave together meditation, mindful movement,
  breathwork and deep guided relaxation, and monthly Breathwork Circles offering
  Conscious Connected Breathwork in a safe and supportive space.
