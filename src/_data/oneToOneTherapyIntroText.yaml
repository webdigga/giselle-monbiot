  ## Transformative Therapy


  Are you feeling overwhelming emotions but cannot work yourself through them? You feel so fed up with trying to avoid the uncomfortable sensations that leave you feeling so tired. You would love to feel more confident and to live more authentically. You are looking for compassionate support to get you through this – to regain your inner strength again.


  Work with me to stop the endless cycle of stress, regain control of your emotions and start feeling excited about life again. My clients often report having more energy, and a deeper connection within. This means they feel more able to cope with the challenges of life. I have a compassionate and gentle approach with the desire to empower you to start enjoying your life again. As a Compassionate Inquiry Practitioner, I include a deep presence and compassion to the sessions you will experience with me.

  ## The Four Pillars of Wholeness


  My therapeutic approach is guided by four essential pillars that support complete wellbeing:


  ### Self


  The journey begins with understanding yourself. Through our sessions, you'll develop deeper self-awareness, recognize patterns that no longer serve you, and cultivate self-compassion. This foundation allows you to build authentic confidence and make choices aligned with your true needs.


  ### Nature


  Reconnecting with the natural world is profoundly healing. I incorporate nature-based practices that ground you in the present moment and remind you of your place within the greater ecosystem. This connection reduces stress, improves mood, and enhances your sense of belonging.


  ### Spirit


  Whether through mindfulness, meditation, or exploring what gives your life meaning, nurturing your spiritual dimension brings clarity and purpose. Our work together honors your unique spiritual path while helping you access inner wisdom and resilience.


  ### Community


  Humans thrive in healthy connection. We'll explore your relationships and how to cultivate supportive bonds that allow you to be authentically yourself. Learning to communicate effectively and set boundaries helps create a community that nourishes rather than depletes.


  ## Transformative 1-to-1 Therapy for the Workplace


  ### Delivering a Deep Impact on Individuals in the Workplace


  I design and deliver individual coaching and stress consultation within the workplace. I provide an opportunity for the individual to explore their unique response to stress, level of resilience and belief pattern.


  Working directly in a one-to-one setting means that the time is spent around specific needs and areas of expertise. This means the results can have a deep impact and ripple out in all areas of life.


  ### Results That Transform:


  * Approach to work

  * Workplace relationships

  * Growth mindset development


  ### Workplace Therapy Includes:


  * Tailor-made therapy and coaching in the workplace

  * Addressing direct causes of stress and feeling overwhelmed at work

  * Working directly with the individual's experience to optimise the results of stress reduction

  * Enabling the individual to work through their unique reasons for feeling overwhelmed

  * Empowering them to gain control of how they respond to their work environment


  ## Compassionate Inquiry Practitioner


  Compassionate Inquiry® is a psychotherapeutic approach created by Dr. Gabor Maté over several decades while working with both patients and retreat participants. It was further developed into a training program by Sat Dharam Kaur ND. This approach gently uncovers and releases the layers of childhood trauma, constriction and suppressed emotion embedded in the body, that are at the root of mental and physical illness and addiction.


  When clients perceive the therapeutic relationship as a safe container, compassion and curiosity allow them to acknowledge and examine the traumatic events that happened to them as children, recognize the beliefs they internalized, and feel the emotions they suppressed. This contributes to the healing process.


  Using Compassionate Inquiry®, both the individual and therapist unveil the level of consciousness, mental climate, hidden assumptions, implicit memories and body states that form the real message that words both express and conceal.


  When we can release ourselves from the hold of these stories, a new way of being emerges, leading to spontaneity, choice, expansion and freedom.
