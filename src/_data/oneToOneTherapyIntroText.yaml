  ## Begin Your Personal Healing Journey in a Supportive, Confidential Space


  I help people gently explore what’s going on beneath the surface of their lives: emotionally, physically, and mentally. This helps them start to feel more connected, calm, and in charge of how they live.


  Often, the way we react to life, whether it’s anxiety, overwhelm, people-pleasing, shutting down, or feeling stuck, comes from old patterns we developed to protect ourselves. These patterns usually stem from past experiences, sometimes going all the way back to childhood. They’re not your fault. But they might be holding you back now.


  In our work together, we look at both what’s happening in your mind (your thoughts, beliefs, and inner stories), and what’s happening in your body (the tension, sensations, and emotional energy stored there). I use a blended approach where I flow between breathwork, somatic awareness, Advanced EMDR for deeper trauma work, and gentle therapeutic inquiry. You can begin to process what hasn’t yet been processed, release what’s no longer needed, and respond to life in a new, more empowered way.


  This is about reclaiming your power, not through blame or force, but through understanding, presence, and choice. It is about moving from reaction to response, from survival to aliveness, and from disconnection to deep, inner clarity.

  ## Transformative Therapy


  Are you feeling overwhelming emotions but cannot work yourself through them? You feel so fed up with trying to avoid the uncomfortable sensations that leave you feeling so tired. You would love to feel more confident and to live more authentically. You are looking for compassionate support to get you through this, to regain your inner strength again.


  Work with me to stop the endless cycle of stress, regain control of your emotions, and start feeling excited about life again. My clients often report having more energy and a deeper connection within. This means they feel more able to cope with the challenges of life. I have a compassionate and gentle approach, with the desire to empower you to start enjoying your life again. As a Compassionate Inquiry&reg; Practitioner, I bring deep presence and compassion to the sessions you will experience with me.

  ## The Four Pillars of Wholeness


  My therapeutic approach is guided by four essential pillars that support complete wellbeing:


  ### Self


  The journey begins with understanding yourself. Through our sessions, you'll develop deeper self-awareness, recognize patterns that no longer serve you, and cultivate self-compassion. This foundation allows you to build authentic confidence and make choices aligned with your true needs.


  ### Nature


  Reconnecting with the natural world is profoundly healing. I incorporate nature-based practices that ground you in the present moment and remind you of your place within the greater ecosystem. This connection reduces stress, improves mood, and enhances your sense of belonging.


  ### Spirit


  Whether through mindfulness, meditation, or exploring what gives your life meaning, nurturing your spiritual dimension brings clarity and purpose. Our work together honors your unique spiritual path while helping you access inner wisdom and resilience.


  ### Community


  Humans thrive in healthy connection. We'll explore your relationships and how to cultivate supportive bonds that allow you to be authentically yourself. Learning to communicate effectively and set boundaries helps create a community that nourishes rather than depletes.


  ## Compassionate Inquiry Practitioner


  Compassionate Inquiry is a psychotherapeutic approach created by Dr. Gabor Maté over several decades while working with both patients and retreat participants. It was further developed into a training program by Sat Dharam Kaur ND. This approach gently uncovers and releases the layers of childhood trauma, constriction and suppressed emotion embedded in the body, that are at the root of mental and physical illness and addiction.


  When clients perceive the therapeutic relationship as a safe container, compassion and curiosity allow them to acknowledge and examine the traumatic events that happened to them as children, recognize the beliefs they internalized, and feel the emotions they suppressed. This contributes to the healing process.


  Using Compassionate Inquiry, both the individual and therapist unveil the level of consciousness, mental climate, hidden assumptions, implicit memories and body states that form the real message that words both express and conceal.


  When we can release ourselves from the hold of these stories, a new way of being emerges, leading to spontaneity, choice, expansion and freedom.

  ## Advanced EMDR


  Advanced EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitisation and Reprocessing) is a neuroscience-based therapeutic approach that builds on the success of traditional EMDR. Unlike standard EMDR, Advanced EMDR takes a somatic approach, bringing the body into the process to make it both safer and more effective. This means the nervous system is supported throughout, allowing deeper healing with less overwhelm. Using eye movements, bilateral stimulation, and embodied techniques drawn from somatic psychology, Advanced EMDR helps the brain reorganise its networks, often described as resetting to “factory settings.” This integration not only relieves the weight of trauma, anxiety, and panic but also opens the way for a healthier, freer outlook on life, where painful memories become simply “something that happened” rather than something that defines you.
