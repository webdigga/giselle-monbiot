  ### About Breathwork


  I am a passionate breathwork facilitator. How we breathe determines our inner state which has a direct impact on our stress levels, physical & emotional health and overall wellbeing.


  I teach people how to breathe to reduce stress, increase energy and create balance in their lives. I do this on a 1 to 1 basis and in groups. I regularly run courses to introduce you to many different breathing techniques to enable you to reduce your overwhelm & stress and feel more vibrant.


  I am a Conscious Connected Breathwork facilitator. I am deeply passionate about CCB as it can bring deep healing and calmness to your busy mind.


  ### Learn to breathe for better health both physically and mentally.


  How you breathe has a direct impact on your nervous system. By learning how to use your breath to connect to what your body needs to increase your window of tolerance means you create a greater resilience in your life and learn to respond rather than react.


  As a trauma-informed therapist, I bring my wealth of knowledge to the sessions creating a welcoming and calm environment for everyone.


  ## Functional Breathwork


  Functional breathwork is a gentle, everyday tool to help regulate your nervous system, reduce anxiety, and bring balance in the face of life’s challenges. It’s designed for use in real-world situations — whether you're navigating a tough day at work, managing stress, or simply seeking to feel more grounded.


  These practices teach you how to breathe in a way that supports health, calmness, and resilience. By tuning into your breath, you can influence how your body responds to stress, helping you return to a state of steadiness and clarity, even when everything around you feels chaotic.


  ## Conscious Connected Breathwork


  Conscious connected breathwork is a deeper, therapeutic practice. This powerful technique uses a continuous, circular breath — with no pauses between the inhale and exhale — to gently open the body and nervous system.


  This form of breathwork creates space to access what may be hidden beneath the surface: unprocessed emotions, old belief patterns, or deeper layers of inner wisdom. It's an opportunity to move beyond the thinking mind and into a more intuitive connection with yourself. People often experience emotional release, clarity, and transformation through this work.
