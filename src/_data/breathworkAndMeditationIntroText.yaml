  # Breathwork & Meditation: Transform Mind & Body


  ## Discover Holistic Practices for Inner Peace and Vitality


  ### About Breathwork


  I am a passionate breathwork facilitator. How we breathe determines our inner state which has a direct impact on our stress levels, physical & emotional health and overall wellbeing.


  I teach people how to breathe to reduce stress, increase energy and create balance in their lives. I do this on a 1 to 1 basis and in groups. I regularly run courses to introduce you to many different breathing techniques to enable you to reduce your overwhelm & stress and feel more vibrant.


  I am a Conscious Connected Breathwork facilitator. I am deeply passionate about CCB as it can bring deep healing and calmness to your busy mind.


  ### Learn to breathe for better health both physically and mentally.


  How you breathe has a direct impact on your nervous system. By learning how to use your breath to connect to what your body needs to increase your window of tolerance means you create a greater resilience in your life and learn to respond rather than react.


  As a trauma-informed therapist, I bring my wealth of knowledge to the sessions creating a welcoming and calm environment for everyone.
