    paragraphs:
      - I'm Anne-Marie, the weaver behind The Perennial Weaver, based in
        Twickenham, Greater London. My passion lies in creating unique,
        handwoven textiles that bring warmth, beauty, and craftsmanship into
        everyday life. Each piece I create is made with care, blending
        traditional weaving techniques with my own artistic vision.
  - heading: My Journey into Weaving
    paragraphs:
      - My love for textiles began in childhood, learning embroidery from my
        grandmother and sewing on my mother's Singer machine. But it was a visit
        to the Anni Albers exhibition at Tate Modern that truly sparked my
        fascination with weaving. Since then, I've explored different
        techniques, working with various looms and materials to refine my craft.
      - For me, weaving is more than a skill - it's a meditative process that
        requires patience, creativity, and an understanding of how different
        fibres interact. I work intuitively, letting each piece develop
        naturally, embracing the unique character that comes from handweaving.

    paragraphs:
      - Every item I create is unique, woven by hand, and designed to be both
        beautiful and functional. My collection includes scarves, bags,
        cushions, table runners, and table mats, each crafted with care to bring
        a touch of artistry into everyday life. The scarves are lightweight and
        breathable for summer, and soft and cosy for winter, woven from
        materials like linen, bamboo, alpaca, and merino wool. The bags combine
        durability with timeless style, perfect for everyday use. The cushions
        feature textured covers that add warmth and individuality to any space,
        while the table runners are designed to bring a handcrafted touch to
        your dining table. The table mats elevate everyday dining with texture
        and colour, offering a subtle, yet beautiful addition to your home.
      - I take inspiration from nature, travel, and architecture, experimenting
        with a variety of fibres such as silk, cotton, and wool. Each material
        behaves differently, influencing the colours, patterns, and textures of
        the final piece. I embrace the subtle imperfections of handweaving,
        knowing they add character and authenticity to my work, making each
        piece truly one of a kind.
