  - question: "What are online slots?"
    answer: "Online slots are digital versions of traditional slot machines found in physical casinos. They feature various themes, paylines, and bonus features, with outcomes determined by Random Number Generators (RNGs) to ensure fair play."
  - question: "Are online slots fair?"
    answer: "Reputable online casinos use certified Random Number Generators that are regularly tested by independent auditors like eCOGRA or iTech Labs. All casinos we recommend are licensed and regulated by recognised gambling authorities."
  - question: "What's the difference between RTP and volatility?"
    answer: "Return to Player (RTP) is the percentage of wagered money that a slot will pay back to players over time. For example, a 96% RTP means the game returns £96 for every £100 wagered long-term. Volatility (or variance) refers to the risk level and payout pattern. Low volatility slots offer frequent but smaller wins, while high volatility slots provide less frequent but potentially larger payouts."
