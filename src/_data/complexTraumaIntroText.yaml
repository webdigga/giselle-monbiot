  ## Complex Trauma (C-PTSD)


  Complex PTSD (C-PTSD) develops through long-term emotional stress or relational trauma, often beginning in childhood. Instead of one defining event, it arises from years of feeling unsafe, unseen or unsupported. This shapes the nervous system and influences how a person responds to life, relationships and their own inner world.


  Common signs include persistent anxiety, overwhelm, numbness, shame, people-pleasing, difficulty with boundaries, chronic tension, digestive issues and sleep disturbances. Because many therapists are trained to recognise only single-event trauma, C-PTSD is often misdiagnosed or overlooked, especially in those who appear high-functioning.


  The hopeful truth is that C-PTSD responds deeply to body-based, trauma-informed approaches that rebuild safety and connection, and help people return to a more grounded, authentic sense of themselves.


  ## Understanding Complex Trauma


  Complex Trauma, often called C-PTSD, develops when a person has lived through ongoing emotional or relational wounding. Rather than one dramatic event, it is the cumulative impact of years of feeling unsafe, unseen, criticised, controlled or unsupported. These experiences often begin early in life, in relationships that should have provided stability, care and protection.


  Many people with C-PTSD don't realise their struggles have a trauma-rooted cause. They often describe themselves as "too sensitive," "too emotional," or "not coping well enough." In reality, their nervous system has been shaped by survival, not by personal failure.


  ## How C-PTSD Shows Up


  Because C-PTSD affects both the nervous system and a person's sense of self, its signs can be varied and sometimes confusing. Common experiences include:


  * Chronic anxiety or emotional overwhelm

  * Numbness or difficulty accessing joy

  * A harsh inner critic, shame or persistent self-doubt

  * People-pleasing, over-functioning or difficulty setting boundaries

  * Feeling disconnected from the body

  * Chronic tension, digestive issues or exhaustion

  * Sleep disturbances

  * Recurring relationship patterns that feel draining or complex


  These are not character flaws. They are intelligent survival responses formed in environments where safety was inconsistent or absent.


  ## Why C-PTSD Is Often Missed


  Many therapists are trained to identify single-event trauma, not the slow accumulation of developmental or relational trauma. Because C-PTSD is still not fully recognised in certain diagnostic frameworks, it is often mislabelled as:


  * Anxiety

  * Depression

  * ADHD

  * Stress

  * Personality issues


  People can appear high-functioning, which further masks the depth of what they carry. This leaves many feeling misunderstood, unseen or as though "nothing quite fits."


  ## A Path to Healing


  C-PTSD responds well to grounded, body-based approaches that work with the nervous system, not just the mind. Healing often includes:


  * Somatic therapy to release stored tension and rebuild inner safety

  * Parts work and gentle inquiry to understand old patterns and soothe protective responses

  * Breathwork to calm the system, build resilience and create space within

  * Compassionate inner work to soften the critic and reconnect with your authentic self

  * Somatic EMDR to reprocess the trauma


  With the right support, the nervous system begins to settle. Clarity returns. Boundaries strengthen. And a steadier sense of connection, vibrancy and inner freedom emerges.
