  ### What is Conscious Connected Breathwork?


  It is simply inhaling and exhaling with no gaps or pauses between the breath. I encourage a full, deep and slow breath rhythm. This is not about overly activating the body, but for you to become present in the moment, to connect to your body and the sensations held there.
