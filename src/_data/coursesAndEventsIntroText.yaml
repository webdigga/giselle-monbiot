  ## Breathwork Circles Every Last Friday of The Month


  Are you looking to find a way to spend the end of the week amongst like-minded people, healthfully releasing the week's stresses and tensions to clear your weekend for relaxation and fun?


  I run monthly Friday evening breathwork sessions – a chance to restore and connect with a like-minded community of people.
