  - quote: Over the past few years, Giselle has supported our school in our mental well-being project.  The parent workshop on helping a worried child and the staff INSET on mental well-being were full of great advice and techniques for parents and school staff. The children really enjoyed learning tips and strategies for mindfulness and relaxation, which they use at home and school.  Giselle has a wealth of knowledge and a lovely way with both children and adults.
