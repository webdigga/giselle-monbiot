  ## Supporting Mental Health and Wellbeing at Work


  I offer tailored one-to-one therapeutic support for employees, helping them build resilience, manage stress, and improve their emotional wellbeing at work. These individual sessions are designed to create lasting change, both personally and professionally.


  I work directly with staff to explore their personal response to stress, identify patterns of overwhelm, and support them in building more effective coping strategies. This personalised approach means that each session is focused on the employee’s specific needs, allowing for deep, meaningful change that can positively impact every area of their life and work.


  ## Benefits for Your Team and Organisation


  Employees who feel supported are more productive, more present, and more engaged in their roles. My workplace therapy and coaching helps reduce absenteeism, prevent burnout, and support a healthier workplace culture.


  **Common outcomes include:**

  - A calmer, more confident approach to work  

  - Improved workplace relationships and communication  

  - A stronger sense of clarity and personal purpose  

  - Increased emotional resilience and self-awareness  

  - A shift from survival mode to empowered response  


  ## My Approach


  I blend therapeutic coaching, somatic awareness, and trauma-informed techniques to help each individual explore what’s really driving their stress or disconnection. The focus is not just on reducing symptoms, but on creating real, lasting change.


  **Services include:**

  - One-to-one therapy and coaching sessions for staff  

  - Confidential support tailored to individual experiences  

  - In-person or remote sessions for flexibility and accessibility  

  - Optional follow-up support to embed changes  


  If you're an organisation looking to support your staff with meaningful mental health and wellbeing services, I’d love to talk about how we can work together.
