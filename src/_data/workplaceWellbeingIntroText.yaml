  ## Workplace Wellbeing that Works


  *Supporting your people. Strengthening your organisation.*


  In today’s fast-paced, high-pressure environments, it’s never been more vital to invest in the wellbeing of your people. At the heart of every thriving organisation is a workforce that feels focused, resilient, and valued. That’s where I come in.


  I offer a tailored approach to workplace wellbeing that goes beyond tick-box solutions, blending therapeutic insight, nervous system regulation, and embodied practices to create meaningful, lasting change.


  ## The Challenge: A Costly Decline in Engagement and Productivity


  Workplaces across the globe are feeling the strain.


  > Global employee engagement fell from 23 % to 21 % in 2024 The first drop (after 2020) since 2009 costing an estimated $438 billion in lost productivity.


  *Gallup, State of the Global Workplace Report, 2024*


  Disengagement doesn’t just affect individual wellbeing. It impacts team cohesion, staff retention, and ultimately, the bottom line. As pressure rises, more employees are reporting increased stress, lower job satisfaction, and a growing sense of disconnect.


  But it doesn’t have to be this way.


  ### The Benefits for Your Organisation


  By prioritising wellbeing and emotional resilience, your organisation can:


  * Reduce workplace stress and burnout

  * Enhance staff focus, energy, and engagement

  * Improve productivity and creative thinking

  * Boost staff morale, loyalty, and retention

  * Build team cohesion and emotional intelligence

  * Foster a healthier, more connected working culture


  When people feel supported, they show up with greater clarity, more commitment, and a deeper sense of purpose. That’s when teams thrive and businesses grow.


  ### Tailored to Your Needs


  No two workplaces are the same. That’s why I offer a **flexible, blended approach** that can be adapted to suit your team and culture:


  ✔️ One-to-one therapeutic support


  ✔️ Team workshops and wellbeing days


  ✔️ Pre-work or lunchtime sessions for stress relief and energy reset


  ✔️ Online or in-person delivery (or a combination of both)


  Whether you're looking to enhance everyday wellbeing or address deeper organisational challenges, we can co-create a programme that meets your goals and fits your environment.


  ## The Human Element


  My work is grounded in over two decades of experience in breathwork, somatic therapy, and trauma-informed practice. I bring a compassionate and practical approach that helps staff feel safe to reflect, reset, and reconnect. Not just to themselves, but to each other.


  This creates more than just a ‘wellbeing initiative’ It nurtures a culture of authenticity, presence, and shared purpose.


  **Let’s create a workplace where people don’t just survive the week, but feel energised, empowered, and equipped to grow.**
