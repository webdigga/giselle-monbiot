Over the years, many people have come to me sharing a similar story:

They’ve had therapy before. It helped them talk things through, maybe even make sense of their past. But in the end, they felt it only touched the surface. Despite the insight they gained, there wasn’t much real change. The same patterns kept showing up, the same feelings remained in the body.

I have witnessed this repeatedly, and it makes perfect sense when you understand how the brain and body respond to trauma.

## How Trauma Shapes the Brain and Body

When we experience trauma, relational disconnection, or a powerful emotional event, the brain is designed to compartmentalise. This is a survival mechanism.

In that moment, the neocortex – the thinking, rational part of the brain – disconnects from the subcortical brain and body – where sensations, emotions and instinct live. This split allows us to survive the experience, but what is unresolved gets stored in the body, often hidden beneath layers of protective shutdown.

That’s why talking therapy alone can feel limited. Talking engages the neocortex, the left side of the brain. It helps us understand, but it doesn’t always reach the deeper places where trauma is held; in the body, the nervous system, and the right side of the brain.

## Why an Integrative Approach Works

What I’ve found in my practice is that healing truly begins when we bring the talking together with somatic and embodied work. This integrative approach allows those disconnected parts of the brain to begin reconnecting.

Through therapeutic inquiry, movement, breath and body-based awareness, we create safe conditions for what has been frozen or shut down to be acknowledged and released. The body begins to trust again. The mind and body start working in partnership rather than in opposition.

Clients often describe it as a sense of coming home to themselves. Instead of reacting from fear, anxiety or old patterns, they can respond from a place of safety and presence.

## Beyond Insight, Into Transformation

This is the difference between knowing your story and truly transforming it.

Talking helps us bring awareness, but awareness alone doesn’t always bring change. When the body is included in the process, healing becomes a lived experience. It is no longer about simply understanding why you feel the way you do, but about freeing the emotions, patterns and protective responses that have been held inside for years.

This is why I work holistically, weaving together talking therapy, somatic practices, breathwork, movement, healing and nutrition. Each element supports the other, creating a pathway back to wholeness.

Because real healing is not about scratching the surface. It’s about integration. Mind and body, left and right brain, thought and feeling – so that you can live with vibrancy, clarity and authenticity once again.
