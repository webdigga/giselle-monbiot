## Thank You

I'm so glad you've reached out — it’s always a privilege to hear from someone ready to take the next step in their personal journey.

I'll be in touch with you very soon. In the meantime, if you're curious to learn more about how I work, there are a few places you might like to explore:

---

### ✨ Therapy with Me

As an [integrative therapist](/1-2-1-therapy/), I draw on a range of approaches to help you feel seen, supported, and gently guided — whether you’re navigating anxiety, relationship challenges, or simply feeling stuck.

---

### 🌬️ Breathwork for Healing & Clarity

I offer two distinct types of [breathwork sessions](/breathwork/):

- **Functional Breathwork** – to calm the nervous system and restore emotional balance  
- **Conscious Connected Breathwork** – a powerful, transformational practice for deeper emotional release

You can read more about how each works and how to get started.

### 🎓 Courses & Events

If you'd rather begin with group work or dip your toes into this world through a more structured setting, take a look at my [courses and upcoming events](/courses-and-events/). These are beautiful spaces for reflection, learning, and connection.

### Let's Stay Connected

Whether you decide to work with me or just want to explore further, you’re always welcome here.

With warmth,  
**Giselle Monbiot**
