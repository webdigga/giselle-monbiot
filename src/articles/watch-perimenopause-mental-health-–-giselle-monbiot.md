In this powerful and heartfelt conversation, therapist and breathwork facilitator Giselle Monbiot joins the podcast to explore the emotional, physical, and spiritual journey of perimenopause. Sharing her own story — including a late ADHD diagnosis — Giselle sheds light on why this stage of life often feels like a breakdown, and how it can instead be a profound breakthrough. From nervous system regulation to relationship shifts, and the healing power of breathwork, this episode is packed with insight, empathy, and practical tools to help women navigate midlife with greater awareness, strength, and self-compassion.
