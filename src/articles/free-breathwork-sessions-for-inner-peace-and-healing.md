## Have you heard about breathwork and are curious to know what it is like?

Maybe you have experienced it and would like to have another experience.  

I am offering four free separate sessions of Conscious Connected Breathwork. These will be held online at various times over October and November.

## What is Conscious Connected Breathwork?

It is simply inhaling and exhaling with no gaps or pauses between the breath. I encourage full, deep and slow breath rhythm. This is not about overly activating the body, but for you to become present in the moment, to connect to your body and the sensations held there.  

## What are the benefits?

The benefits of this work are far-reaching.  

### Physical benefits can include:

* Increased energy  
* Strengthen immune system  
* Access body memories  
* Deep relaxation and calm  

## Mental and emotional benefits:

* Make the unconscious conscious  
* Calm the ‘monkey’ mind  
* Gain clarity  
* Emotional activation  

## Spiritual benefits can include for some:

* Unity consciousness  
* Connection to loved ones  
* A sense of wholeness  

If you want to join me for one or more of these sessions, please follow this link for further information and booking your space.

I am limiting the spaces to 8 people.
