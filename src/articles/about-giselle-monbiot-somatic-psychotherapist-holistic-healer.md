## My Philosophy: The Four Pillars of Connection

At the heart of my practice lies the fundamental belief that true wellbeing emerges when we nurture four essential connections:

### Connection to Self

Reconnecting with your authentic core is the foundation of all healing. Through somatic awareness, breathwork, mindful practices and therapeutic enquiry, I enable you to rediscover the clarity of your inner voice. It’s about being in a regulated state where you can feel your own presence, tune into your inner world, and respond to life from a place of safety and awareness rather than reactivity or survival. The goal isn’t to always be “regulated,” but to recognise when we’ve moved away from connection, and gently find our way back.

### Connection to Others

This is about your capacity to feel safe in relationship. To be seen, heard, accepted, and to offer that same presence in return. When we are connected to others from a place of regulation we experience co-regulation. That subtle, powerful nervous system-to-nervous system dance that tells us: you are safe, you are not alone, you matter. Healing occurs in relationship with others. This can be in the form of a therapeutic relationship or a group setting, where vulnerability is met with kindness and compassion.

### Connection to World & Nature

Having awareness of your sense of safety and belonging within your environment. This includes your surroundings, communities, and the natural world. It’s about how your nervous system responds not just to people, but also to places, spaces, and systems around you. When this connection is strong, we feel more anchored, empowered, and at ease in daily life.

### Connection to Spirit

Your felt sense of something greater than yourself. This could be interpreted in many ways depending on your belief system. As a connection to a higher power, divine presence, the soul, universal energy, nature, love, or simply a deep inner wisdom that guides and holds us. it’s about cultivating a sense of being held, guided, and connected beyond the physical.

## My Offerings

### Integrative Therapy

I offer an integrative approach that connects what’s happening in your mind with what’s being held and expressed in your body. By weaving together therapeutic exploration, breathwork,and somatic practices, I support you to release old patterns, feel more present, and reconnect with your true self.

### **Mindful Movement**

A gentle, body-led practice that helps you reconnect with yourself through slow, intentional movement. It supports emotional release, eases tension, and brings calm to the nervous system, helping you feel more grounded, present and at ease. Offered as part of therapy sessions, in group courses, or as a standalone session, this practice is accessible to all bodies and no experience is needed.

### **Courses & Events**

Throughout the year, I offer a range of specialised events and courses designed to support healing, reconnection and inner balance. These include breathwork courses where you’ll learn the restorative art of conscious breathing, women’s groups that weave together meditation, mindful movement, breathwork and deep guided relaxation, and monthly Breathwork Circles offering Conscious Connected Breathwork in a safe and supportive space.

### **Retreats**

My retreats offer a sacred pause from the busyness of life. A space to slow down, reconnect, and nourish your whole self. Held in calming, natural settings, these one day, multi day or seasonal gatherings weave together breathwork, mindful movement, therapeutic inquiry, guided relaxation, and conscious connection with others. Each retreat is carefully crafted to support emotional release, inner clarity and a return to your authentic rhythm. Whether you're seeking renewal, healing, or space to simply be, these retreats offer a deeply held space to come home to yourself.

## My Journey

For the past 26 years, I have walked the path of healing. First for myself, and now for the women I support. My journey began at 18, navigating deep trauma, grief, and isolation without the authentic support I so deeply needed. Over time, I came to realise that I wasn’t broken. I simply needed to sit with my unexpressed emotions, release the stories that weren’t mine, and trust my own inner voice rather than the limiting beliefs of others. Through years of personal exploration and professional training, I have gathered a powerful and integrative toolkit that helps women untangle the patterns, coping mechanisms, and self-doubt that keep them stuck.

Now, as a Compassionate Inquiry® Practitioner trained by Dr. Gabor Maté, a trauma-release specialist, and an advanced breathwork facilitator, I guide women through their own journeys of healing and transformation. I take a deeply holistic approach, working with the mind, body, and breath to create a space where real change can unfold. Whether in one-to-one sessions or group settings, I help women navigate life’s transitions—including the often-overlooked emotional impact of perimenopause—so they can release what no longer serves them, reconnect with their truth, and step into a life where they truly thrive.
