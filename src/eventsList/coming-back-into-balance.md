**A warm, supportive Spring Equinox retreat to pause, breathe and come back into balance.**

The Spring Equinox is a gentle turning point. A moment when light and dark come back into balance, inviting you to do the same. After the heaviness and quiet endurance of winter, this season offers a pause to soften, breathe and reconnect with yourself. As nature begins to stir, something within you is also waking up. A sense of renewal, possibility and readiness for change. This is an invitation to let go of what has been weighing you down and to consciously nurture what feels ready to grow.

## About the Retreat

Coming Back into Balance is a day retreat designed to support you in reconnecting with yourself away from the demands and noise of everyday life.

Through breathwork, reflection and embodied practices, you will be gently guided to release what no longer serves you, clear the residue of winter, and create space for renewed energy and intention.

This is time to slow down, to listen inwardly, and to sow seeds. Not through effort or pressure, but through presence. A nurturing space to restore balance, reconnect with your natural rhythm, and step into the coming months feeling more grounded, energised and aligned.

## Who This Retreat Is For

This retreat is for midlife women who feel pulled in many directions; holding responsibilities, caring for others, and keeping life moving, often without pausing to check in with themselves.

It's for those who sense a need to slow down, to rest and release, yet find it hard to create the space to do so. You may feel tired, out of balance, or disconnected from your own needs, even while continuing to put one foot in front of the other.

This retreat is an invitation to pause.

A chance to step out of the momentum of everyday life and gently reflect on whether the direction you're moving in truly feels right for you now. To notice what you're carrying, what's draining your energy, and what is quietly asking for your attention.

If you're longing for time to reconnect with yourself, restore your energy, and step forward with greater clarity and intention, this day is for you.

## You Might Be Feeling...

* Tired, even when you're "doing all the right things"
* Pulled between responsibilities, with little space left for yourself
* A sense that something needs to change, but uncertainty about what
* Disconnected from your body, your energy or your inner voice
* Ready for a fresh start, yet unsure how to begin
* Longing for rest that feels genuinely nourishing, not just sleep

## What You'll Leave With

* A deeper sense of balance and steadiness in your body and nervous system
* Greater clarity about what's draining your energy — and what nourishes it
* A felt connection to yourself, beyond roles and responsibilities
* Simple practices you can take into daily life to support balance and regulation
* A clearer sense of what you want to nurture in the months ahead
* A feeling of being replenished, grounded and gently reoriented towards yourself

## If You're Wondering...

**"I'm not sure I can take the time."**
This day is an invitation to step out of busyness so you can return with more presence, clarity and energy. Often, giving yourself this space allows everything else to flow more easily.

**"I feel guilty prioritising myself."**
Many women feel this way. This retreat offers a gentle reminder that caring for yourself is not selfish; it's essential. When you are resourced, everyone benefits.

**"I don't know what I'll experience."**
You don't need to arrive with answers or expectations. Everything offered is invitational, guided with care, and held within a safe, supportive space. You are free to engage at your own pace.

## Step Into Your Balance

It's easy to put yourself last, to keep moving through life without pausing to check in. This retreat is an invitation to do something different. To step out of busyness, release what's been weighing you down, and reconnect with your own energy, clarity, and sense of direction.

You don't need to have all the answers or know exactly what will emerge. This day is about presence, gentle reflection, and creating space for renewal. Giving yourself this time isn't indulgent. It's necessary. When you restore your energy and balance, everything else in your life can flow more easily.

Spaces are limited to ensure a nurturing, personal experience. Reserve your place today and step into the season feeling lighter, clearer, and more aligned with what truly matters to you.
