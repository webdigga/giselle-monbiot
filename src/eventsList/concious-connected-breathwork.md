## What is Conscious Connected Breathwork?

Conscious Connected Breathwork (CCB) invites you to breathe without gaps or pauses—inhale, exhale, inhale—in a full, deep, and slow rhythm. This guided practice isn’t about overstimulation; it's an opportunity to be fully present, reconnect with bodily sensations, and release stored tension.

## Monthly Breathwork Circles

Join a like-minded community each month for an evening of collective release and renewal. Every session offers space to let go, drop into your body, and reconnect with your breath.

These circles take place on the **last Friday of every month at 7:15 pm**.

## Benefits of the Practice

Participants often report:

* Increased energy and immune strength  
* Deeper relaxation and release of tension  
* Greater clarity and emotional calm  
* Activation and integration of stored emotions  
* A sense of unity, wholeness, and spiritual connection  

As a trauma-informed therapist, I cultivate a welcoming, safe space where healing can unfold gently and authentically.
