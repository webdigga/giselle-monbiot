## **Would you love a space each week to soften into yourself, release stress, and reconnect with what really matters?**

This gentle, deeply nourishing group offers exactly that – a midweek sanctuary where women come together to breathe, move, and reconnect with themselves and each other.

This **intimate, women-only group** explores breathwork and somatic practices in a way that feels real, grounded, and supportive. It’s a space that’s quietly powerful – candlelit, calming and free-flowing – where we follow what the moment calls for.

The group is usually full, as the experience often becomes a regular part of each woman's week. If you feel drawn to join, you’re warmly invited to reach out to check availability.

## **What to Expect**

Each session begins gently, with tea, conversation, and space to settle. From there, we move into grounding practices, breathwork, and somatic movement designed to ease the nervous system and deepen presence. We close with guided relaxation and, where needed, subtle healing work.

While the experience can be deep and transformational, there’s also room for laughter, lightness, and being fully yourself. It’s not about striving or fixing – it’s about softening, releasing, and coming home to your truth.

This space is ideal for women who have some experience with breathwork and are ready to go a little deeper, held in a group of like-minded, open-hearted souls.
