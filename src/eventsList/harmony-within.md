**A One-Day Immersive Workshop**
Facilitated by Giselle Monbiot & Oliver Baum

> **There is a meeting place within you — where presence meets power, where devotion meets direction. When the sacred masculine and feminine unite within, wholeness becomes not just possible… but inevitable.**

*Harmony Within* is not a workshop of the mind. It is a journey into the **felt, living relationship** between the inner masculine and feminine. Through breath, body and soul work, you are invited to go beyond the concept of balance… and begin to **embody it**.

This is an opportunity to explore how these sacred energies move through you:
How they speak, create, protect, feel.
Where they are in harmony and where they are not.
What has been passed to you from your family line and what is ready to be released.

We will open space for what is unseen to be gently revealed. You will be guided to meet the inner relationship between the masculine and feminine as a real, dynamic force. One that has shaped your responses, your relationships, your sense of direction and belonging.

**✧ A Soul-Led Approach**

We begin with the foundations: not just what masculine and feminine energies are, but how they **move** through your daily life — in how you hold boundaries, how you trust, how you act or allow rest.

Through conscious breathwork, somatic exploration, and systemic constellation work, we invite you to feel this relationship not just intellectually, but viscerally through the belly, the heart, and the mind.

Together, we will:

* Bring awareness to the inherited patterns that shape your inner dynamic
* Explore the echoes of the mother and father wound, and how these shape our internal world
* Make space for what longs to emerge when both energies are seen, honoured, and brought into right relationship
* Reconnect to what is greater — the flow of life, the unseen support behind you, and your own sacred place within it all

This is about coming home to a deeper centre. One that is responsive, not reactive. Rooted, yet open. Whole.

**✧ This Work is For You If…**

* You often feel pulled between doing and being, giving and receiving
* You feel exhausted from over-performing, over-caring, or holding it all together
* You sense old family patterns repeating in your relationships or inner life
* You long for a deeper sense of groundedness, spaciousness, and inner harmony
* You’re ready to integrate past wounds, not bypass them and to meet life as it is, with grace and presence

**✧ What You May Walk Away With**

* A clearer, more compassionate understanding of your inner energetic landscape
* A felt sense of what balance looks and feels like for you
* Insight into the ancestral and systemic patterns shaping your inner world
* A softening into your own truth, with permission to be both held and directed, receptive and strong
* The beginning of a new relationship with yourself: one of inner union, trust, and authentic power
