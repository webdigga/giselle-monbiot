Join my online sessions to experience Conscious Connected Breathwork, bringing deep calm, clarity, and connection.

Due to high demand for in-person sessions, I am offering four online sessions at an introductory rate of £20 each. You can join one or all sessions in a safe, supportive space.

## **What is Conscious Connected Breathwork?**


A simple yet powerful practice of continuous breathing. I guide you to a full, steady rhythm, encouraging presence, relaxation, and connection to your body. This is an invitation to notice sensations, release tension, and open a pathway to insight and healing.

## Benefits

* Physical: increased energy, relaxation, and access to body-held memories
* Mental & emotional: clarity, insight, emotional release
* Spiritual: a sense of wholeness, connection to life and loved ones
