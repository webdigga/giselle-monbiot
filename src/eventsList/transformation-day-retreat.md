There’s a quiet kind of disconnection many women live with.

Life on the outside might look fine, maybe even good. You’re managing, supporting others, and doing what’s needed. But inside, something feels off. Like you’ve drifted from yourself. As if you’re living a life that no longer feels like your own.

You might not be able to name what’s missing. Only that something doesn’t feel right.

This one-day retreat is for women who feel that ache and are ready to explore it.

## What the Day Is About

**Remembering You** is not about fixing yourself. It’s about listening deeply. Together, in a small, supportive group of women, we’ll begin to explore:

* Where you may have lost connection with your inner self
* How beliefs and coping strategies formed earlier in life may still shape your identity
* What you’ve been carrying that’s no longer yours to hold
* What’s been waiting underneath it all, quietly asking for space to emerge

## What You’ll Experience

This retreat gently blends Compassionate Inquiry&reg;, somatic practices, and therapeutic breathwork to help you reconnect with yourself on every level. Mind, body and breath.

**Your day will include:**

* 🌀 Group Compassionate Inquiry – Explore inner patterns and beliefs that may keep you stuck, quiet or disconnected
* 🧘‍♀️ Somatic movement and awareness – To reconnect with your body’s wisdom and release tension held within
* 🌬️ Regulating breath practices – To support emotional resilience and nervous system balance throughout the day
* 🌕 Conscious Connected Breathwork – A guided deep-breathing journey to access insight, release stored emotion, and reconnect with your authentic self
* ✍️ Journaling and reflection – Focused prompts to help ground what you discover

**You don’t need to be in crisis.**
You don’t need to know exactly what’s wrong.
This retreat is for women who simply feel the quiet pull that something needs to change and are ready to listen.
